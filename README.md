JavaSysMon
==========

JavaSysMon is designed to provide an OS-independent way to get live system information such as CPU and memory usage, distributed as a single jar file. It is written in C and Java. However the native binaries are hidden away inside the jar (thanks to [one-jar](http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/)), so you never need to worry about them.

Currently it supports Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, and Solaris. Ultimately we aim to support everything from AIX to Android.

If youâ€™re interested in adding support for a new platform, check out the project wiki.

Download latest
---------------

The current version of JavaSysMon is 0.2.0, released December 28th. You can get it here: http://github.com/jezhumble/javasysmon/downloads

Run it with java -jar

Building and running
--------------------

Run ant, and then:

    java -jar target/javasysmon.jar

Using the library from code
---------------------------

Simply put the jar in your classpath, and use it like this:

    import com.jezhumble.javasysmon.JavaSysMon;
       
    JavaSysMon monitor =   new JavaSysMon();
    
    String osName =        monitor.osName();
    long uptimeInSeconds = monitor.uptimeInSeconds();
    int currentPid =       monitor.currentPid();
    CpuTimes cpuTimes =	   monitor.cpuTimes();
    MemoryStats physical = monitor.physical();
    MemoryStats swap =     monitor.swap();
    int numCpus =          monitor.numCpus();
    long cpuFrequency =    monitor.cpuFrequencyInHz();

Current support and limitations
-------------------------------

* Currently supports Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, and Solaris
* Solaris binary is compiled on x86 on OpenSolaris, so it won't work on SPARC, and may not work on SunOS < 5.11
* Solaris CPU usage only correctly reports usage for first CPU.
* Supports Java 1.4 and above
* CPU speed on Linux only reports correct values for Intel CPUs
