JavaSysMon is designed to provide an OS-independent way to get live system information such as CPU and memory usage, distributed as a single jar file. It is written in C and Java. However the native binaries are hidden away inside the jar (thanks to one-jar: http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/), so you never need to worry about them.

Currently it supports Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. Support for Solaris is planned next. Ultimately we aim to support everything from AIX to Android.

JavaSysMon monitor = new JavaSysMon();
String osName = monitor.osName();
long uptimeInSeconds = monitor.uptimeInSeconds();
float cpuUsage = monitor.cpuUsage();
long totalMemory = monitor.totalMemory();
long freeMemory = monitor.freeMemory();
long totalSwap = monitor.totalSwap();
long freeSwap = monitor.freeSwap();
int numCpus = monitor.numCpus();
long cpuFrequency = monitor.cpuFrequency();

Current support and limitations
